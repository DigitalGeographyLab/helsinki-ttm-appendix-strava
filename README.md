# Aggregating and de-identifying Strava Metro data for use in travel time matrix computation

This repository contains supplmentary data to a manuscript currently under
review (description will be updated once a positive decision is reached).

The [Jupyter Notebook](strava-speed-index.ipynb) describes the steps taken to
aggregate and de-identify data downloaded from Strava Metro (this is required to
meet the company's terms of use), as well as additional data exploration and
filtering. These data are then used to inform the cycling routes computed for
[Helsinki region travel time
matrices](https://github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/Helsinki-Travel-Time-Matrices).
